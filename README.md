# docker-skink

Docker image for running the Skink program verification tool from Macquarie University.
Contains Java, Scala, sbt plus auxiliary programs such as SMT solvers (e.g., Z3).
Also contains the [benchexec](https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/blob/master/doc/INDEX.md) framework to run Skink under conditions similar to those of the International Software Verification Competition, including the competition benchmark files.
